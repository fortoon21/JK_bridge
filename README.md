## Technical Integration

### Pool info aggregator for pathfinder

#### code

- https://github.com/fortoon21/JK_bridge/blob/c335665a3f99eb632d48bf190a028daea13b4f18/packages/aggregator/lib/viewer.ts
- this can fetch all pool info in 2-5 seconds by multicall

#### generated example

### The graph

#### Diagram

#### Used subgraph

https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/0xfind/uniswap-v3-mumbai

- Success to integarte uniswap v3 in mumbai
- subgraph for quickswap mumbai and sushiswap mumbai is not available, we can add subgraph for those later

#### How we use The Graph

The graph is used for aggregating pool info. We are aggregating all pool informaion from event, but we can have better performance using The Graph.
